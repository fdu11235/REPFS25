# 📊 REP_2025: Market Prediction with Deep Learning

This project focuses on predicting financial market movements using deep learning models and advanced backtesting techniques. It uses PyTorch for modeling, vectorbt for portfolio backtesting, TA-Lib for technical indicators, and SHAP for model explainability — all inside a GPU-accelerated Docker + Conda environment.

---

## Features

- ✅ Training pipeline for market prediction 
- ✅ Backtesting with vectorbt 
- ✅ Technical indicators via TA-Lib
- ✅ SHAP explainability for model interpretation
- ✅ Preprocessing and statistical analysis utilities
- ✅ Fully reproducible Conda + Docker setup
- ✅ GPU-enabled Dev Container support in VS Code

## Getting Started

### Requirements

- Docker
- Docker Compose
- optional: NVIDIA GPU + CUDA Drivers (for GPU support)
- [VS Code + Dev Containers Extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode-remote.remote-containers) (optional)

---

### Run in a Dev Container

```bash
docker-compose build
docker-compose run trading_app
```

Or, open the project in **VS Code**, press `F1`, then choose:

```
Dev Containers: Reopen in Container
```

---

### Workflow

Once docker container is running use following commands:

**Activate conda environment inside container:**

```bash
conda activate trading-env
```

**Running Experiments:**

```bash
python src/run_experiment.py
```

Individual steps from the experiments can also be run from the following commands:

**Preprocess data:**

```bash
python src/run_preprocess_dataset.py
```


**Train your model:**

```bash
python src/run_torch_training.py
```

**Predict on out-of-sample data:**

```bash
python src/run_predict_asset.py
```

**Run backtest:**

```bash
python src/run_backtest.py
```

**Explain model predictions with SHAP:**

```bash
python src/run_shap_explainer.py
```

## Local Development

It is also possible to just develop in a local conda environment.
Use following command to create a conda environment and to install dependencies.

```bash
conda env create -f environment.yml
```

## Notes

- Run settings and paths are configured via `src/config/`
- Use the `--gpus all` flag with Docker or use the `nvidia` runtime (already handled in `docker-compose.yml`)
